# j390
A z390 application server for providing 3270 applications

The j390 is an application server for playing with z390 and TN3270 emulators. 
An user svc (X'C0') has been created in order to control some objects from j390.

This is a first version of this software. The z390 emulator was added to my PSJ product.
